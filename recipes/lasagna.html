        <h2>The Recipe</h2>

         <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. 
            Lightly oil a 9×13 baking dish or coat with nonstick spray.</li>

            <li>In a large pot of boiling salted water, 
            cook lasagna noodles according to package instructions.</li>

            <li>Heat olive oil in a large cast iron skillet over medium high
            heat. Add ground beef and onion and cook until beef has
            browned, about 3-5 minutes, making sure to crumble the
            beef as it cooks; season with salt and pepper, to taste.
            Drain excess fat. 
            Stir in tomatoes and Italian seasoning until well combined.</li>

            <li>In a medium bowl, combine ricotta, 1/2 cup mozzarella 
            and egg; set aside.</li>
            
            <li>Spread 1 cup tomato mixture onto the bottom of a 9×13 baking
            dish; top with 3 lasagna noodles, 1/2 of the ricotta cheese
            mixture and 1 cup mozzarella cheese. Repeat with a second
            layer. Top with remaining noodles, 
            tomato mixture, 1 cup mozzarella cheese and Parmesan.*</li> 

            <li>Place into oven and bake for 35-45 minutes, or until bubbling.
            Then broil for 2-3 minutes, or until top is browned in spots.
            Let cool 15 minutes.</li>
                
            <li>Serve, garnished with parsley, if desired.</li>    
         </ol>
