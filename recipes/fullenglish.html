    <h1>Full English Breakfast Recipe</h1>
    <img src="../images/fullenglish.jpg" alt="Full English Breakfast Image" height="310" width="310">
    <p>We get a lot of visits from our American, Canadian 
        and Australian cousins who frequently ask us how 
        to make a proper English breakfast and about the 
        right ingredients, so we created this full English 
        breakfast recipe just for you, we British probably 
        already know how to make it.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li><strength>4 </strength>pork sausages</li>
        <li><strength>6 </strength>strips of back bacon</li>
        <li><strength>4 </strength>eggs</li>
        <li><strength>1 </strength>tomato</li>
        <li><strength>2 cups </strength> of mushrooms</li>
        <li><strength>1 can </strength>of baked beans</li>
        <li><strength>200g </strength>of black pudding</li>
        <li>Tea or Coffee</li>
        <li><strength>Fresh</strength>orange juice</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>The Recipe</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>The first thing to do is grill your bacon, that 
            will take the longest and grilling it under 200
             degrees, turning it occasionally will make sure 
             it cooks evenly on both sides. Cut notches in the 
             fat so it doesn't curl up when it cooks, making it
             more difficult to crisp up the fat.</li>
        
        <li>Next you need to start frying your bread. 
            Fried bread is one of the English breakfasts 
            dirty little pleasures because its so greasy,
             but fried bread is brilliant with a fried egg 
             on top and makes your breakfast deliciously 
             crunchy. Fry two slices and put them on a plate
             to stay warm near the grill.</li>

        <li>Once your fried bread is done, now start frying
             your tomatoes and mushrooms. They only need 
             to be lightly fried before being put on the hot 
             plate with your fried bread to await breakfast
             assembly.</li>

        <li>Now start cooking your sausages and black 
            pudding, you can fry them in the same pan and
            they need to be fried evenly and well to make
            sure they are both cooked inside and out.</li>

        <li>Before your sausages are done cooking, put the
            other two pieces of bread in the toaster or
            under the grill. When they are toasted, put
            them on the hotplate with the other waiting 
            ingredients.</li>

        <li>When you put your toast in is a good time to
            start cooking your baked beans, they usually
            just need to be heated up and you can do that 
            in 2 minutes in a microwave or in a small 
            pan on the stove. We like to serve them in 
            a little pot so that they do not spread</li>

        <li>When your sausages and black pudding are 
            ready, assemble all of the ingredients on 
            their final plates for serving. Plates should
             be large enough to hold all the ingredients 
             of a full English breakfast comfortably 
             without everything feeling cramped.</li>
    </ol>
